	product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing
	the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various
	approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning
	the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear
	problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given
	problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential
	for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial
	differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this
	survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution
	algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value
	problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK
	and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options
	available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator)
	around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning
	process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this
	paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide
	proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent
	methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how
	JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide
	sources of further practical information.},

  abstract = { We present a new approach for the k-eigenvalue problem using a combination
	of classical power iteration and the Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov
	method (JFNK). The method poses the k-eigenvalue problem as a fully
	coupled nonlinear system, which is solved by JFNK with an effective
	block preconditioning consisting of the power iteration and algebraic
	multigrid. We demonstrate effectiveness and algorithmic scalability
	of the method on a 1-D, one group problem and two 2-D two group problems
	and provide comparison to other efforts using similar algorithmic
